**Coding Raja Technologies Intership under Machine Learning**

During my internship, I led two Python-based projects: "Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data" and "Image Classification for Food Recognition." These projects demonstrate my expertise in machine learning, showcasing practical applications to analyze sentiment trends on social media and accurately classify food images, addressing real-world challenges in the respective domains.



**1. Task 1:** [Task 1](https://github.com/1234HEMU/Coding-Raja-Technologies-Internship/blob/main/Task%20-1__SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS.ipynb)
```
Description: Build a sentiment analysis model to classify social media posts as positive, negative, or neutral.

Steps:

Data Collection: Gather a dataset of social media posts with labeled sentiments.
Text Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing special characters, stopwords, and performing tokenization.
Feature Extraction: Convert the text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Model Selection: Choose a suitable classification algorithm such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or a neural network.
Model Training: Train the selected model using the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Create a simple web interface where users can input their own text for sentiment analysis.
Tech Stack:

Python
Natural Language Processing libraries 
Machine Learning frameworks 
```

**2. Task 2:** [Task 2](https://github.com/1234HEMU/Coding-Raja-Technologies-Internship/blob/main/TASK_2___IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION_FOR_FOOD_RECOGNITION.ipynb)
```

Description: Develop an image classification model to recognize different types of food items from images.

Steps:

Data Collection: Collect a dataset of food images categorized into various classes.
Data Preprocessing: Resize images, normalize pixel values, and split data into training and testing sets.
Model Architecture: Choose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture like VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet.
Transfer Learning: Use a pre-trained model and fine-tune it for your specific food classification task.
Model Training: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy and other relevant metrics on the test dataset.
Visualization: Visualize model predictions and explore misclassified images.
Tech Stack:

Python
Deep Learning frameworks 
Image processing libraries
```
